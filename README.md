# Analysis of Course reviews
Analysis plays a very important role, either for a product launch, product sustainability in the market, or to understand customers and make them happy with an improved product. It may be a digital or a physical one. Both of them require a certain kind of understanding of the available data for further improvement. Here is one such analysis of reviews given to the courses.
## Overview of the Project :
This project is completely done in Python. The dataset used in the project consists of 45000 rows X 4 columns, which makes it complex and difficult to analyze using any other tools. So python makes it simple and efficient to analyze. The main aim of the project is to learn and derive useful information from the given data, which could help in building/updating the courses and understanding customer (learner) behavior.
